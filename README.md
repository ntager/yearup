======

building mobile webpages for yearup.org

[x]Q: How do we make a gh-pages branch so that we can browse? A: If using the application, 
go to the branches window and press the little "+" sign at the right of an existing branch. 
(Might be best to have everything synched before making a new branch? Then adjust the branch?)

[x]Q: How to put returns into this "readme.md"? A: It is a "markdown" file, which puts returns
when it sees blank lines. See [markdown] (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 

[x]Q: Can I put links in here? A: Yes! http://nymets37.github.com/yearup/ works!


notes
=====
The official yearup webpage is using sub_section=newyork for partners and volunteers but probably ought to be using sub_section=national
