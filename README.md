building mobile webpages for yearup.org

[x]Q: How do we make a gh-pages branch so that we can browse? A: If using the application, 
go to the branches window and press the little "+" sign at the right of an existing branch. 
(Might be best to have everything synched before making a new branch? Then adjust the branch?)

[x]Q: How to put returns into this "readme.md"? A: It is a "markdown" file, which puts returns
when it sees blank lines. See [markdown] (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 

[]Q: Can I put links in here? [Test one] (http://nymets37.github.com/yearup/)
