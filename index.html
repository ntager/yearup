<p>Hi. This is section one. Hey Noah, Mike has put the links into the "&lt;header>" zone inside a "&lt;nav>" block, which is a named thing provided by HTML5 for just this kind of situation: a bunch of navigation links at the top of a page. I've edited the style commands so our links don't have the "float:left" and I've also removed the "width:25%" temporarily, (wondering whether the links should be so wide when someone is using a wide screen device).</p>
<p>PS: Noah, I'm trying to move all the styling info into the "&lt;style" zone at the top, to let the "&lt;body>" be as simple as possible. This way we can have one stylesheet for all of our mobile pages.</p>
