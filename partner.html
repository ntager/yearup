<p><b>Preparing a pipeline of entry-level talent.</b><br /> </br>
Through Year Up's program, corporate partners work with desktop support/help desk interns and, in some cities, financial operations, quality assurance or project management interns, who continue to recieve intensive skills training.</p>
<img src="http://www.yearup.org/images/partners/highlight_95_partners.png" alt="More than 90% of Year Up interns meet or exceed their internship manager's expectations.">
<p><b>Why become a Year Up Partner?</b><br /> </br>
&bull; Working with Year up interns offers a chance to train and get to know potential employees before making hiring decisions: a "try before you buy" approach to bring in talent.<br />
&bull; Upon graduation, Year Up interns are a source of entry-level, diverse human capital.<br />
&bull; Interns undergo reference checks, interviews and testing, and receive relevant technical and professional training.<br />
&bull; Regular feedback and collaboration ensures Year Up interns meet your company's expectations.<br />
&bull; Year Up provides extensive "hands-on" support throughout the internship via continuing education, monitoring and coaching intern performance.<br />
&bull; Internship partners may hire Year Up graduates at the conclusion of the program without a placement fee, saving your company recuriting time and resources.
