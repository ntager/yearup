<center><h1>What is the Opportunity Divide?</h1></center>
<p><b>6 million young adults</b> with no more than a high school diploma are out of work, out of school and without access to the economic mainstream.  But they have a lot of talent.</p>
<p>Year Up connects young adults who need opportunites to companies who need talent.</p>
<p><b>14 million jobs</b> requiring post-secondary eductation will go unfilled in the next decade.</p>
<center><h1>Two sides of a city, worlds apart.</h1></center>
<p><b>We are wasting talent when we can't afford to waste anyone.</b>
</br>
Millions of young adults in this country are facing social and economic injustice. Despite talent and motivation, they lack access to higher education and careers that provide them with a living wage. At the same time, our economy needs help. U.S. businesses are calling for more and better-trained talent to compete on the global stage, but there will not be enough skilled workers to meet that demand.</p>
<p><b>Economic justice = Economic prosperity.</b>
</br>
These are troubling realities, but they represent a tremendous national opportunity. Providing underserved young adults with the skills, knowledge and experience today's businesses demand ensures those young adults will begin successful careers and earn a living wage. In return, employers gain access to a wider pipeline of well-trained talent than ever before â€”the talent they need to compete across the globe.</p>
<p><b>A hand up, not a hand out.</b>
</br>
This is not charity, nor a handout. This is good sense. Economic justice for young adults equals economic prosperity for U.S. businesses, and the nation at large.
